## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue or pull request** as this may expose the vulnerability to a wider audience before it is resolved.

### To report a vulnerability:

1. **Join the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/FVQxgBysA7)** and report the issue privately to the admin team.

### Our commitment:

- We aim to address all security vulnerabilities within **7 business days**.
- You will be kept informed of our progress as we work to resolve the issue.
- Your report will be kept **confidential**.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
